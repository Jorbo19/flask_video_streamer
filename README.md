# flask_video_streamer
I will combine Flask with OpenCV, enabling me to:  Access frames from RPi camera module or USB webcam. Process the frames and apply an arbitrary algorithm (here weâ€™ll be using background subtraction/motion detection, but you could apply image classification, object detection, etc.). Stream the results to a web page/web browser.
